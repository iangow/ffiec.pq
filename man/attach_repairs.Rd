\title{Attach FFIEC repair metadata to a data frame}
\usage{
attach_repairs(df, repairs)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame or tibble to which repair metadata should be attached.}

\item{repairs}{Character vector of repair or processing labels
(e.g., `"embedded-newline"`, `"fallback-slow-path"`,
`"coerced-invalid-dates"`).}
}
\value{
The input data frame `df`, with a `"ffiec_repairs"` attribute attached.
}
\description{
`attach_repairs()` records the set of repairs or processing events applied
during ingestion by attaching them as an attribute on a data frame.

The function performs minimal normalization:
- coerces the input to character,
- drops `NA` and empty values,
- removes duplicates.

It does **not** interpret or validate the repair labels; it simply stores them.
}
\details{
Repair metadata is stored as a simple character vector in the
`"ffiec_repairs"` attribute. Downstream code may choose to surface this
attribute as a list-column or ignore it entirely.
